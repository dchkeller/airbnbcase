## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The included code runs on the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this case study, I was interestested in using AirBnB data to understand:

1. Question a?
2. Question b?
3. Question c?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](link-to-my-blog).
